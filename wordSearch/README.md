This application is the precursor to Zupple, which is currently under development. Therefore,
the fine tuning of many aspects is happening within Zupple and not within WordSearch. However,
Wordsearch can successfully generate word search and crossword puzzles and save them to html
files!

About the word searches: The source of the words can be a text file or the user can enter the
words through the command prompt. 3 files are saved at the end of this process: a color html file,
a black-n-white printable html file, and a .wsg file, which is basically like a text file.

About the crossword puzzles: This is the newest addition to the project. The source for these
must be a text file. In each line of the text file, there should be a word and clue separated 
by a hyphen. 1 html file is saved at the end of the process.

Feel free to check out Zupple, where this project is being developed into a RESTful API, connected
to a database to store puzzles, with a user-friendly front end!
