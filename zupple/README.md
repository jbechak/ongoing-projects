It started as a word search generator, then a sudoku generator, and then a crossword puzzle generator,
and now it's Zupple! This application combines all 3 of these original programs, which generate puzzles
to view and print. It will soon connect to a database to store your puzzles and feature a user-friendly 
front end interface. I'm currently doing a lot of clean up as I combine these once independent programs.
Lots of similarities abound between them, which will allow for some object-oriented fun!
