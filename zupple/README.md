It started as a word search generator, then a sudoku generator, and then a crossword puzzle generator,
and now it's Zupple! This application combines all 3 of these original programs, which generate puzzles
to view and print. It will soon connect to a database to store your puzzles and feature a user-friendly 
front end interface. I'm currently doing a lot of clean up as I combine these once independent programs.
As it's currently under construction, certain primary features may not always work. However, in the 
meantime, my original word search, crossword, and sudoku puzzle applications are all available and 
functioning on GitHub.
