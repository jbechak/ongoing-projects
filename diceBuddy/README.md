DiceBuddy let's you roll the dice, learn about some rolling odds, and enjoy RISK mode.
For dice rolling, you can roll as one player or choose multiple players and multiple dice. 
RISK mode emulates the dice rolls of the board game Risk. Odds mode will calculate the odds
of every possible combination coming up for different amounts of dice rolled. There is also
a feature that will calculate the odds involved in Risk dice rolls.
